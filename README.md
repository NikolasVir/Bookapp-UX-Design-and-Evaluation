## UX Design and Evaluation - CS364 Course Project

## Project Overview
This repository contains the work of our UX Design and Evaluation team project for the undergraduate course CS364. Our journey began with simple pencil mockups, evolving through various design stages to create both low-fidelity and high-fidelity designs.

### Design Process
- **Pencil Mockups**: The initial concepts were sketched out using pencil to capture the fundamental design ideas.
- **First Drafts**: These drafts translated our pencil mockups into more concrete design representations.
- **Low-Level Designs**: We developed more detailed designs, focusing on the user interface elements and interactions.
- **High-Level Designs**: The final designs were refined versions that incorporated all the feedback received and represented the complete user experience.

### Feedback Sessions
At each stage of our design process, we conducted feedback listening sessions with our instructor. These sessions were crucial in guiding the evolution of our designs and ensuring they met the course objectives and user needs.

## Final Report
The `FINAL_REPORT_TEAM_11.pdf` file includes the findings from usability tests conducted with three participants. The report details the aspects of the system that were well-received and those that required changes.

## Project Scope
It is important to note that the scope of this project did not include implementing the changes suggested in the `FINAL_REPORT_TEAM_11.pdf`. The primary goal was to design, evaluate, and document the UX process.
